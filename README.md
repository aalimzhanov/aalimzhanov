Hello, my name is Adil Alimzhanov. I am currently a third year student in Mount Allison university in New Brunswick Canada. I am doing a BSc with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. Most of my work here is in Java, although I also know Python. If you want to reach me, email me at "aalimzhanov@mta.ca".
